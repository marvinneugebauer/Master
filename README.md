#  Improving Image Based Object Detection of Street Scenes with the Help of Depth Estimations
<h3>Abstract:<h3>In autonomous driving one of the major issues we are faced with, is the question how an autonomous vehicle percieves it's surrounding eviroment, which is given by a street scence. When a street scene is percieved  by an autonomous vehicle, one of the most important tasks then is to detect all of the scenes objects, specially those objects that pose a danger for driving. A state of the art approach to that problem is to let semantic segmentation algorithms do the task of dectecting the different object that are in the scene. Those sematic segmentation algorithms use an adapted form of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), so called Semantic Segmentation Networks. Despite the fact that Semantic Segmentation Networks has been increasingly successful in performing on object dection tasks in recent years, there perfomance is still limited. 
In the following we propose and exermine a possible way how to improve the performance Semantic Segmentation Networks with the help of depth estimations.

#  Improving Image Based Object Detection of Street Scenes with the Help of Depth Estimations
**Abstract:** One of the major issues in autonomous driving is the question how an autonomous vehicle correctly percieves it's surrounding eviroment, which is given by a street scence. That means once a street scene is percieved  by an autonomous vehicle, how it can be achieved that all of the scenes objects are detected successfully, specially those objects that pose a danger for driving. A state of the art approach to that problem is to let semantic segmentation algorithms do the task of dectecting the different object that are in the scene. Those sematic segmentation algorithms use an adapted form of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), so called Semantic Segmentation Networks. Despite the fact that Semantic Segmentation Networks has been increasingly successful in performing on object dection tasks in recent years, there perfomance is still limited. Even the best Semantic Segmentation Networks can not provide an accuracy, where 
In the following we propose and exermine a possible way how to improve the performance Semantic Segmentation Networks with the help of depth estimations.
